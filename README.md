💻 This is my Jira app. It is an improved version of the To-Do List.

💎 This project has three different categories of lists: “To Do,” “In Progress,” and "Completed".

🤍 You can move an item you've added to the 'To-Do' list to the 'In Progress' list. And once you've completed the task, you can move it to the 'Completed' section.


📌 📌 📌 NOTE: The project is still in progress and not yet complete.
