💻 This is my Task Flow Manager App. It is an improved version of the To-Do List.

💎 This project has three different categories of lists: “To Do,” “In Progress,” and "Completed".

🤍 You can move list items using drag and drop.

✅ In this project, the contenteditable, ondragover, ondragenter, and ondrop properties were used in the HTML file.
✅ All list items are created, edited, and deleted using JavaScript.
✅ The changes made are stored in LocalStorage.
